# Stolen Bike Cases - Backend (Node.js)

Coding Challenge Guidelines
===========================

## Context
Stolen bikes are a typical problem in a lot of major cities. The Police want to be more efficient in resolving stolen bike cases. They decided to build a software that can automate their processes â€” the software that you're going to develop. 

## Product Requirements
- [+] Bike owners can report a stolen bike.
- [+] New stolen bike cases should be automatically assigned to any free police officer.  
- [+] A police officer can only handle one stolen bike case at a time. 
- [+] When the Police find a bike, the case is marked as resolved and the responsible police officer becomes available to take a new stolen bike case. 
- [+] The system should be able to assign unassigned stolen bike cases automatically when a police officer becomes available.

## Tech Requirements
- Node.js
- **Tests (quality and coverage)**
- You are free to use any framework, but we prefer Vue
- Use any database (preferably Firestore)
- Typescript is a plus, but not required
